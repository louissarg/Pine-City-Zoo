          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>
            Giraffes are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest
            ruminants. They are a species of African even-toed ungulate mammal
            belonging to the genus Giraffa. Their long necks and legs, along
            with their distinctive coat patterns, make them easily recognizable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and
            flowers of woody plants. They are known for their unique method of
            locomotion called "pacing," where both legs on one side move forward
            simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
          <p>
            You will find the giraffes at pen E23, right next to the elephants.
