          <h3>KOALA</h3>
          <p>
            Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their
            distinctive appearance and behavior. They have a stout, tailless
            body, large head with round, fluffy ears, and a large black nose.
            Their fur is thick and soft, typically gray or brown in color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koalas are primarily herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on
            eucalyptus leaves. They have a slow metabolism and spend most of
            their time sleeping or resting in trees to conserve energy. Koalas
            are known for their unique vocalizations, which can be quite loud
            and are used to communicate with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong>
            <br />
            You will find the koalas at pen E24, right next to the giraffes.
